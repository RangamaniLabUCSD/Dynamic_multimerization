# Dynamic_multimerization
This repository has all the source code, input files, analysis scripts, and sample data used to simulate dynamic dimerization of proteins within condensates. 
The directories are organized by figure number with subdirectories for the input files used to run the associated set of Cytosim simulations and the analysis output files used to generate the figures.
Figures can be generated from these data files by using the Figures.ipynb Jupyter Notebook and following the sections within.
